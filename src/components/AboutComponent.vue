        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
          Globe & Citizen the company is a fully remote company operated from locations spread
          around the world. Our goal is to innovate and iterate until we are Web3.0’s premier
          distributed news network. Global issues such as pandemics, supply chain entanglement, and
          climate change, to name only a few, cannot be solved by any one nation acting alone.
          Therefore, we have set out to create a global forum that is free from singular regional
          interests. Leveraging the incredible advances in information technology, such an
          aspiration is very much possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Globe & Citizen the Website</h3>
        <p>
          The team at Globe & Citizen is hard at work laying the foundations for Globe & Citizen in
          the form of Celebrity Fanalyzer, a celebrity gossip blog. The goal is to create a platform
          where open source ranking algorithms can be developed, and chosen, by users.
          Simultaneously, we aim to develop a framework for algorithmic compensation using crypto
          that incentivizes independent journalists and regional news agencies to publish and
          participate on our platform. The technology necessary to do this already exists. The
          challenge is compensating those authors who make the best contributions. Of course, what
          is the definition of best? To help answer this question and define, “what is the best
          content,” Globe & Citizen is to become the world’s first Anthroscope – an invented term
          for what we are trying to build.
          <br />
          An Anthroscope, like any other scope (telescope microscope, oscilloscope), is designed to
          give its users the capacity to view something with a new perspective. To function, an
          anthroscope will leverage modern statistical analysis and big data to produce clever
          visuals reflecting the unbiased opinion scape of any users viewing any particular piece of
          content. If done correctly, an anthroscope should have the power to make obvious the
          inherent biases of a viewer by reflecting back to them who they are and where they fit in
          the opinion scape. From this new perspective, a rational individuals should be able to
          infer their own truth. To be fair, Anthroscopes already exist. For example, look at your
          YouTube home page. It is not populated at random. It is a reflection of you.
