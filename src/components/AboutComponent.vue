          Globe & Citizen the company is a fully remote company operated from locations spread
          around the world. Our goal is to innovate and iterate until we are Web3.0â€™s premier
          distributed news network. Global issues such as pandemics, supply chain entanglement, and
          climate change, to name only a few, cannot be solved by any one nation acting alone.
          Therefore, we have set out to create a global forum that is free from singular regional
          interests. Leveraging the incredible advances in information technology, such an
          aspiration is very much possible.
