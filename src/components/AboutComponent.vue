        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>
          Globe & Citizen is a fully remote company operated from locations spread around the world. Our goal is to
          innovate and iterate until we are Web3.0’s premier distributed news network. We are not a DAO. Rather, we are
          organizing as the world’s first Crypto Native Corporation.
        </p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          Global concerns such as pandemics, inflation, and climate change, to name only a few, are issues that cannot
          be solved by any one nation acting alone. Therefore, we have set out to create a global forum that is free
          from singular or centralized regional interests. Leveraging the incredible advances in information technology
          and the Web3.0 space, such an aspiration is very much possible.
        </p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>
          The team is working hard to lay the foundations for Globe & Citizen in the form of Celebrity Fanalyzer, a celebrity gossip blog. The goal is threefold:
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>To create a platform where opensource ranking algorithms can be developed, and chosen, by users.
            </li>
            <li>Make accessible the fully anonymized metadata associated with any particular piece of content allowing users to see an unbiased “opinion-scape.”
            </li>
            <li>Develop a framework for algorithmic compensation to incentivize independent journalists and regional news agencies to publish and participate on our platform.
            </li>
          </ol>
          The technology necessary to accomplish these three goals already exists. The challenge is in execution. Using Celebrity Fanalyzer as a learning platform, we are hard at work trying to make Globe & Citizen a reality.
